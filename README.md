# cm-web-assessment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It serves as a promotional website for an online tech education platform, built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev) for visual elements, alongside Next.js for the framework.

## Getting Started

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project locally. These instructions cover cloning the repository, navigating to the project folder, installing dependencies, and starting the development server.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup instructions, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.17 or higher (check with `node -v`). Download from [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if needed.
- **Yarn**: Version 1 or higher (check with `yarn -v`). Install via [Yarn Classic Installation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if not present.

To verify, run the following commands in your terminal:

- `node -v` should output something like `v18.17.0` or higher.
- `yarn -v` should output something like `1.22.19` or higher.

If versions are insufficient, update them via their respective official websites or use a version manager like `nvm` for Node.js.
